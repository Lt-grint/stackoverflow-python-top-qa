yield关键字的作用","keywords":"","body":"1. yield关键字的作用\n题目\n\"yield\"关键字是做什么的？链接\n回答一\n想要理解yield关键字，你必须先理解generators是什么，理解generators之前要先理解iterables.\nIterables\n当你创建一个list，你可以一个个的读其中的元素，一个一个读就叫做iteration：\n>>> mylist = [1, 2, 3]\n>>> for i in mylist:\n...    print(i)\n1\n2\n3\n\n这里的mylist就是一个iterable。当你用一个list，你先创建一个list，这就是一个iterable：\n>>> mylist = [x*x for x in range(3)]\n>>> for i in mylist:\n...    print(i)\n0\n1\n4\n\n任何你使用“for...in...”的地方就是一个iterable；例如lists，strings，files...\n这些iterables使用很方便。因为你可以想读多少读多少，但是你需要把它们都存在内存里面，当你有很多值的时候这样可能就不太好了。\nGenerators\nGenerators也是iterators，是一种只能遍历一遍的iterable，Generators并不把所有值都存在内存里，而是在遍历过程中生成这些值：\n>>> mygenerator = (x*x for x in range(3))\n>>> for i in mygenerator:\n...    print(i)\n0\n1\n4\n\n这个和使用list一样只是你用()而不是[]，只是你不能再次使用形如for i in

什么是元类（metaclass）\n题目\n什么是元类，我们用它来干什么？链接\n回答一\n元类是类的类。就像一个类定义了类的一个实例的行为，一个元类定义了一个类的行为。类是元类的实例。\n\n在Python中，你可以使用任意的可调用的元类(如Jerub的回答)，更有用的方法实际上是使它本身成为一个实际的类。类型（type）是Python中常用的元类。正如你所想的那样，type本身就是一个类，它是它自己的类型。你将无需在Python中重新创建类似于type的东西，但是Python有一点有一定的欺骗性。要在Python中创建自己的元类，你实际上只需要子类化type。\n元类通常用作类工厂。就像你通过调用类创建类的实例一样，Python通过调用元类创建一个新类(当它执行“类”语句时)。与常用的__init__和__new__方法相结合，元类允许你在创建类时做“额外的事情”，比如注册新的类和一些注册表，甚至完全替换类。\n在执行class语句时，Python首先将class语句的主体作为正常的代码块执行。由此产生的命名空间(一个命令)包含将呈现的类的属性。元类是通过查看将呈现的类的基类(元类继承的)，在其__metaclass__属性(如果有)或__metaclass__全局变量来确定的。然后使用类的名称、基础和属性调用元类来实例化它。\n然而，元类实际上定义了类的类型，而不仅仅是它的工厂，因此你可以与它们做更多的事情。例如，你可以在元类上定义常规方法。这些元类方法类似于类方法，因为它们可以在没有实例的类上调用它们，但是它们也不像类方法，因为它们不能在类的实例上调用它们。__subclasses__()是在type元类上的一个方法的例子。你还可以定义普通的“魔术”方法，例如__add__、__iter__和__getattr__，以实现或更改类的行为。\n下面是一些零碎的例子:\ndef

Less time to do an equivalent operation is better:\n现在，我们可以看到使用 in 要比其他方法快很多，等价操作下耗时越少越好。\n>>> perf_dict\n{'in:True': 0.16450627865128808,\n 'in:False': 0.1609668098178645,\n '__contains__:True': 0.24355481654697542,\n '__contains__:False': 0.24382793854783813,\n 'find:True': 0.3067379407923454,\n 'find:False': 0.29860888058124146,\n 'index:True': 0.29647137792585454,\n 'index:False': 0.5502287584545229}\n\n  geekcircle              updated 2018-05-30 22:44:12  "},"stackoverflow/12.how-do-i-check-if-a-list-is-empty.html":{"url":"stackoverflow/12.how-do-i-check-if-a-list-is-empty.html","title":"12. 如何检查列表是否为空","keywords":"","body":"12. 如何检查列表是否为空\n题目\n例如，如果通过以下内容:\na = []\n\n我如何检查a是否为空?\n链接\n回答一\nif not a:\n    print(\"List is empty\")\n\n使用空列表的隐式booleanness是相当python的（Pythonic）。\n回答二\npython风格的方法是来自PEP 8风格指南(在这里，Yes的意思是“推荐”，而NO是“不推荐”):\n对于序列，(字符串、列表、元组)，使用“空序列为假”的这一事实\nYes: if not seq:\n     if seq:\n\nNo:  if len(seq):\n     if not len(seq):\n\n  geekcircle              updated 2018-05-30 23:21:11  "}}}
