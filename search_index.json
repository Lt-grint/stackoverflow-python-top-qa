mygenerator = (x*x for x in range(3))\n>>> for i in mygenerator:\n...    print(i)\n0\n1\n4\n\n这个和使用list一样只是你用()而不是[]，只是你不能再次使用形如for i in mygenerator因为它只能被使用一次，它从0开始计算，然后抛弃它再计算1，一个接一个。\nYield\nyield是一个关键字类似return的用法，一个函数使用时会返回一个generator。\n>>> def createGenerator():\n...    mylist = range(3)\n...    for i in mylist:\n...        yield

print(i)\n0\n1\n4\n\n当你知道你的函数会返回很多数据，并且你知道你仅仅需要读取一次这些值的时候，这么用很方便。\n想要掌握yield，你需要明白当你调用这个函数的时候，你写的代码并没有实际地在run，而只是返回了一个generator的对象，这里有一些tricky。\n然后，你的代码会在每一次for循环使用这个generator的时候run起来。\n接下来，最难的部分：\n当for循环第一次调用这个generator的时候，你的代码会从最开始运行，直到yield语句，然后他会返回这个循环的第一个值。然后每一次调用，都会再一次运行这个function并且返回下一个值，直到没有值可以返回。\n一旦这个function运行到再也不会hit yield语句，这个generator会被视为空，因为这个时候循环结束了，或者你不满足你的if else语句了。\n  geekcircle              updated 2018-05-16 21:39:58
