yield关键字的作用","keywords":"","body":"1. yield关键字的作用\n题目\n\"yield\"关键字是做什么的？链接\n回答一\n想要理解yield关键字，你必须先理解generators是什么，理解generators之前要先理解iterables.\nIterables\n当你创建一个list，你可以一个个的读其中的元素，一个一个读就叫做iteration：\n>>> mylist = [1, 2, 3]\n>>> for i in mylist:\n...    print(i)\n1\n2\n3\n\n这里的mylist就是一个iterable。当你用一个list，你先创建一个list，这就是一个iterable：\n>>> mylist = [x*x for x in range(3)]\n>>> for i in mylist:\n...    print(i)\n0\n1\n4\n\n任何你使用“for...in...”的地方就是一个iterable；例如lists，strings，files...\n这些iterables使用很方便。因为你可以想读多少读多少，但是你需要把它们都存在内存里面，当你有很多值的时候这样可能就不太好了。\nGenerators\nGenerators也是iterators，是一种只能遍历一遍的iterable，Generators并不把所有值都存在内存里，而是在遍历过程中生成这些值：\n>>> mygenerator = (x*x for x in range(3))\n>>> for i in mygenerator:\n...    print(i)\n0\n1\n4\n\n这个和使用list一样只是你用()而不是[]，只是你不能再次使用形如for i in mygenerator因为它只能被使用一次，它从0开始计算，然后抛弃它再计算1，一个接一个。\nYield\nyield是一个关键字类似return的用法，一个函数使用时会返回一个generator。\n>>> def createGenerator():\n...    mylist = range(3)\n...    for i in mylist:\n...        yield

print(i)\n0\n1\n4\n\n当你知道你的函数会返回很多数据，并且你知道你仅仅需要读取一次这些值的时候，这么用很方便。\n想要掌握yield，你需要明白当你调用这个函数的时候，你写的代码并没有实际地在run，而只是返回了一个generator的对象，这里有一些tricky。\n然后，你的代码会在每一次for循环使用这个generator的时候run起来。\n接下来，最难的部分：\n当for循环第一次调用这个generator的时候，你的代码会从最开始运行，直到yield语句，然后他会返回这个循环的第一个值。然后每一次调用，都会再一次运行这个function并且返回下一个值，直到没有值可以返回。\n一旦这个function运行到再也不会hit yield语句，这个generator会被视为空，因为这个时候循环结束了，或者你不满足你的if else语句了。\n  geekcircle              updated 2018-05-11 01:40:20

Python中有三目运算符吗","keywords":"","body":"3. Python中有三目运算符吗\n题目\n如果Python没有三目运算符，是否有可能使用其他数据结构来模拟？链接\n回答一\nPython2.5开始加入三目运算符\n语法如下\na if condition else b\n\n首先计算condition, 然后根据condition的值返回a或b\n例如\n>>> 'true' if True else 'false'\n'true'\n>>> 'true' if False else 'false'\n'false'\n\n注意：conditionals是表达式，而非语句，这意味着不能在conditionals中使用赋值、pass或其他语句。\n>>> pass if False else x = 3\n  File \"\", line 1\n    pass if False else x = 3\n          ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n在上例中，仅使用if语句即可。\n\n这个语法在Python社区也引发了很多争论，原因如下\n\n参数的顺序与C语言、Ruby、Java等不同，Python的初学者易写出bug\n有人认为不方便写（unwieldy），因为这与正常的思维方式（先考虑条件，再考虑效果）相悖 \n风格上的原因\n\n官方文档：\n\nConditional expressions\nIs there an equivalent of C’s ”?:” ternary operator?\n\n回答二\n用元组的下标（index）来模拟:  (falseValue, trueValue)[test]，test需要返回true或者是false\n这样实现更安全： (falseValue, trueValue)[test == True]\n或者使用内置的bool确保是个布尔值：(falseValue, trueValue)[bool()]\n>>> a = 10\n>>> ('kid', 'adult')[a >= 18]\n'kid'\n\n  geekcircle              updated 2018-05-09 02:01:44  "}}}
